### How to get the book
The book can be purchased from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Finite-Element-Method-Smith/dp/1119973341/

### How I am connected to the book
The owner of this git repository: Daniel Kidger worked with the authors during his period at the University of Manchester (1983-2001). He is particularly indebted to Prof. Ian Smith who was his Ph.D. Supervisor as well as his team leader during his subsequent years as a Post.Doc and Lecturer.

This is the 5th Edition of the book - updated in 2013 

Previously:
   * The [4th Edition (2007)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Finite-Element-Method-Smith-ebook/dp/B000QEIO1W/) has as its cover a mesh of Lamaload Dam on its cover. _I also get a small mention in the Acknnowledgements_. This was analysed and post-processed using the tools in [Danfe](https://github.com/dannyk96/Danfe). That suite of FE tools was developed fom the programs found in the 2nd Ediition of this book

   * The 3rd Edition had as its cover a 3D mesh of the LHC tunnels at CERN. Again this mesh was analaysed and plotted using derivations iof the programs in an earlier additon of this book
